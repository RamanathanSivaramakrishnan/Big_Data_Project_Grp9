Communication plan to include project artifact repository
Cumulatively we came up with the idea of taking a dataset related to health. 
Each one of us came up with a dataset related to different health issues. 
Heart being the crucial organ of the body, we decided to go with Predicting the Heart Disease dataset.
Project Repository: 
 
2)  Business Problem or Opportunity, Domain Knowledge (link to information on domain relative to data, problem or opportunity)
The heart disease is increasing day by day at a rapid rate. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common type of heart disease, 
where major blood vessels are damaged which supply blood to the heart.
It would be beneficial to predict the people who are vulnerable to heart disease by identifying the important factors.
Our idea is to focus on which person has a high risk of developing a heart disease with the medical information in hand.
There are several factors that increase the risk of heart disease such as smoking habit, Stroke, Blood pressure, Cholesterol, diabetes etc.
 
The dataset is chosen from the world health organization. Heart Disease prediction dataset contains the gender, age, education and health 
related attributes like smoker, consuming blood pressure medication, prevalent hypertension, total cholesterol. 
By performing Exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and visualization on the dataset, 
we can identify which features can contribute in identifying whether the person will develop a heart disease or not.

4)  Research Objectives and Question(s) (what you are trying to describe or predict with the data)

Is there a correlation exists between the heart rate with various factors
such as diabetes, total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, Body Mass Index?

Does a particular age group have a high risk of developing heart disease?

Is only the medical attributes contributing in identifying the heart disease rather than physical conditions like age, gender etc.?

Identify which medical factor contributes more to heart disease compared with the 10 year CHD?

Identify the threshold value of cholesterol that contributes to heart disease?

Does taking BP medication have a reduced chance of developing heart disease than compared to people who do not take medication?

Which type of blood pressure account contributes more to heart disease?
